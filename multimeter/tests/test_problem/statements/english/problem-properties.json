The most important problem for these settlements is the fire safety problem, because the majority of the buildings are made of wood. It's necessary to construct a number of fire stations along the road, where fire-engines will based at.\r\n\r\nFire station can be built only in a settlement, and the cost of the construction differs in each settlement. Number all the settlements sequentially from 1 to $n$ and denote by $c_i$ the cost of fire station construction for settlement number $i$. \r\n\r\nSettlements are situated along the road almost uniformly, so we consider that a fire-engine can reach any neighboring settlement in 1 hour. If it takes more then $k$ hours to get to burning building then it can't be saved. Therefore, a ride from a fire station to any settlement mustn't take more than $k$ hours.\r\n\r\nDetermine the minimal cost of constructing the fire stations in the settlements.","authorLogin":"tchikh","language":"english","timeLimit":2000,"output":"Output a single number, minimal expense for building all the fire stations.","inputFile":"fire.in","outputFile":"fire.out","input":"First line of input contains two numbers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10000$, $0 \\le k \\le 100$)~--- number of settlements on the road and maximal time for the fire-engine to get to the burning building.\r\nSecond line contains $n$ numbers $c_i$ ($0 \\le c_i \\le 10^{6}$)~--- fire station constructions cost for $i$-th settlement.","authorName":"Kirill Tchikhatchev","sampleTests":[{"output":"3","input":"4 2\r\n2 4 3 2\r\n"},{"output":"3","input":"3 1\r\n2 3 2\r\n"}],"name":"Fire stations","interaction":null,"memoryLimit":67108864,"tutorial":"Use dynamic programming.
